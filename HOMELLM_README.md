# HomeLLM - AI-Powered Home Health Advocacy Platform

An intelligent application designed to help homeowners, tenants, and advocacy organizations draft professional, legally-grounded emails to escalate home health and safety concerns to HOAs, utility companies, government agencies, and other entities.

## üéØ Purpose

HomeLLM empowers individuals and organizations focused on indoor home evaluations and optimization (air purifiers, water filters, etc.) to effectively advocate for healthier living environments by:

- Drafting professional correspondence backed by federal, state, and local regulations
- Analyzing water quality reports and warranty documents
- Providing regulatory citations and legal frameworks
- Escalating concerns appropriately based on issue severity
- Documenting evidence and health impacts systematically

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

## üß† How It Works

### Regulatory Training Data

The system uses a comprehensive knowledge base organized by:

**Federal Level:**
- Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Fair Housing Act
- EPA standards (PM2.5, lead, VOCs, water contaminants)
- HUD housing quality standards
- OSHA workplace standards

**State Level:**
- State-specific environmental laws (California CARB, NY mold laws, etc.)
- Stricter state standards (CA lead 5ppb vs federal 15ppb)
- State tenant protection laws
- State water quality rules

**Local Level:**
- International Building Code (IBC)
- International Residential Code (IRC)
- Local municipal ordinances
- HOA governing documents

### AI Prompt Engineering

The system constructs detailed prompts that include:

1. **Expert Persona**: Legal/environmental health advocate with regulatory knowledge
2. **Regulatory Context**: Relevant laws, standards, and citations for the specific issue
3. **Escalation Guidance**: Tone, approach, consequences, and timeline based on escalation level
4. **Recipient Guidance**: Specific strategies for HOAs, landlords, utilities, government
5. **Structural Requirements**: Subject line, opening, legal framework, action items, closing
6. **Evidence Integration**: Photos, measurements, health impacts, previous contacts

### Urgency Assessment

Automatic emergency detection based on:
- Keywords: "carbon monoxide", "gas leak", "collapse", "unconscious"
- Thresholds: CO > 70ppm, Radon > 10 pCi/L, lead in blood > 5 Œºg/dL
- Alerts user to call 911 if emergency detected

## üìä Supported Issue Types & Standards

| Issue Type | Key Standards | Agencies |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Air Quality / Mold | No federal mold limit (EPA guidance); PM2.5: 12 Œºg/m¬≥ annual | EPA, CDC, State Health Depts |
| Water Quality | Lead: 15ppb; Arsenic: 10ppb; PFAS: 4ppt (proposed) | EPA, State Water Boards |
| HVAC/Ventilation | ASHRAE 62.2: 15 CFM/person + 3 CFM/100 sq ft | ASHRAE, HUD, Local Building |
| Lead/Asbestos | Lead dust: 10 Œºg/ft¬≤ (floors); Asbestos: NESHAP rules | EPA, HUD, OSHA |
| Radon | 4 pCi/L action level | EPA, State Health Depts |
| Carbon Monoxide | 9 ppm (8-hour); 35 ppm (1-hour) | EPA, Local Fire Dept |

## üîê Security & Privacy

## üé® Customization

### Adding New States
Edit `regulatory-knowledge-base.js`:
```javascript
states: {
  YourState: {
    airQuality: { laws: [...], standards: {...}, agencies: [...] },
    waterQuality: { laws: [...], standards: {...} },
    tenantRights: { laws: [...], repairTimelines: '...', remedies: '...' }
  }
}
```

### Adding New Issue Types
1. Add to `issueTypes` array in `HomeLLM.jsx`
2. Add mapping in `issueTypeMapping` in `regulatory-knowledge-base.js`
3. Add federal regulations in `regulatoryKnowledgeBase.federal`

### Customizing Escalation Levels
Edit `getEscalationGuidance()` in `email-prompt-engine.js`

### Changing AI Model
Edit `MODEL` constant in `api-integration.js`:
```javascript
const MODEL = 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'; // Change to different model
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**"Invalid API key" error:**
- Ensure key starts with `sk-ant-`
- Check key at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
- Verify sufficient API credits

**Email generation fails:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify all required fields are filled
- Try reducing image count/size
- Check browser console for detailed errors

**Document analysis not working:**
- Only image formats supported (JPEG, PNG)
- PDF requires manual text extraction for now
- Ensure image is clear and readable

**Drafts not saving:**
- Check localStorage is enabled in browser
- Clear browser cache if quota exceeded
- Try incognito/private mode to test
