# PDF Support for Water Report & Warranty Analysis

## ‚úÖ PDF Support Now Enabled

Water report and warranty document analysis now fully supports PDF files in addition to images.

## üìÑ Supported Formats

### Water Report Analysis:
- **PDF files**: Up to 32MB
- **Image files**: JPG, PNG - Up to 5MB

### Warranty Document Analysis:
- **PDF files**: Up to 32MB
- **Image files**: JPG, PNG - Up to 5MB

## üîß How It Works

The app now uses Claude's native document processing capabilities:

1. **Upload**: User uploads PDF or image file
2. **Validation**: File size checked (32MB for PDF, 5MB for images)
3. **Encoding**: File converted to base64 data URL
4. **API Call**: Sent to Claude API with proper content type:
   - PDFs use `type: 'document'` with `media_type: 'application/pdf'`
   - Images use `type: 'image'` with appropriate media type

## üìä API Request Format

### For PDF Documents:
```json
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "document",
          "source": {
            "type": "base64",
            "media_type": "application/pdf",
            "data": "<base64_encoded_pdf>"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Analyze this water quality report..."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### For Images:
```json
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",

          }
        },
        {
          "type": "text",

## üß™ Testing PDF Upload

### Test Water Report Analysis with PDF:
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Click "Water Report Analysis" tab
3. Upload a water quality report PDF (e.g., from Denver Water, EWG, etc.)
4. Click "Analyze Report"
5. Wait 20-40 seconds for analysis

**Expected Output:**
- Contaminants identified
- EPA standard comparisons
- Health risk assessment
- Recommendations for action
- Regulatory citations

### Test Warranty Analysis with PDF:
1. Click "Warranty Analysis" tab
2. Upload warranty document PDF
3. Click "Analyze Warranty"
4. Wait 20-40 seconds

**Expected Output:**
- Coverage summary
- Exclusions and limitations
- Claim process details
- Consumer rights information
- Action items and deadlines

## üîç Error Handling

### File Too Large:
If file exceeds size limits, you'll see:
- PDFs > 32MB: "File too large. Maximum size: 32MB"
- Images > 5MB: "File too large. Maximum size: 5MB"

### Unsupported Format:
The file input only accepts:
- PDF: `.pdf`
- Images: `image/*` (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, etc.)

### API Errors:
- **400 Bad Request**: File may be corrupted or improperly formatted
- **413 Payload Too Large**: File exceeds API limits (reduce size)
- **429 Rate Limit**: Too many requests (wait and retry)

## üí° Why PDFs Are Better for Reports

Water quality reports and warranty documents are often distributed as PDFs:
- **Preserves formatting**: Tables, charts, and layout maintained
- **Multi-page support**: Can analyze entire documents
- **Better OCR**: Claude can extract text from scanned PDFs
- **Official documents**: Most agencies provide PDFs, not images

## üìù Technical Changes

### Modified Files:

**src/api-integration.js:**
- Updated `generateEmail()` to detect PDF vs image file type
- Add document content type for PDFs
- Maintain image content type for images

**src/HomeLLM.jsx:**
- Added file size validation in `handleWaterReportUpload()`
- Added file size validation in `handleWarrantyUpload()`
- Updated `handleAnalyzeWaterReport()` to send PDFs properly
- Updated `handleAnalyzeWarranty()` to send PDFs properly
- Added UI hints showing supported formats and size limits

## üöÄ Performance Notes

### Analysis Time:
- **Small PDFs (1-5 pages)**: 20-30 seconds
- **Large PDFs (10+ pages)**: 40-60 seconds
- **Images**: 15-25 seconds

### Cost:
- PDFs generally use more tokens (more content to process)
- Typical water report PDF: $0.03-0.06
- Typical warranty PDF: $0.02-0.05

### File Size Recommendations:
- Keep PDFs under 10MB for best performance
- Use compressed PDFs when possible
- For very large documents, consider splitting into sections
